# Repository Agent Instructions

## Pull Request Readiness

Codex is pre-approved to mark draft pull requests as ready for review in this
repository when the requested work is complete, required checks and review-app
verification are passing or any non-blocking skip is documented, and there are
no known unresolved blocking review comments or user-requested changes.

Codex does not need to ask again before running `gh pr ready` under those
conditions. If required checks are failing, review-app verification is broken,
or blocking feedback remains unresolved, leave the pull request as draft and
report the blocker instead.

## Agent Workflow Configuration

Portable shared skills resolve this repo's commands and policy through:
- **Commands** — run `.agents/bin/<name>` (`setup`, `validate`, `test`, ...); see `.agents/bin/README.md`. A missing script means that capability is n/a here.
- **Policy / config** — `.agents/agent-workflow.yml`.

## Review and Merge Gate

Before merging, require every current-head `gh pr checks` entry to pass, all
review threads to be resolved, and GitHub to report clean mergeability. The
local RSpec wrapper does not replace the Lefthook pre-push checks or
monorepo-wide lint and formatting checks documented in `.agents/bin/README.md`.
Draft readiness also requires the review-app verification described above.
The seam grants no standing merge authority; follow the direct user or
maintainer instruction. Keep CI, workflow, build, dependency, runtime, broad
refactor, and release changes maintainer-gated.

Prefix follow-up titles with `Follow-up:`.
